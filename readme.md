Advanced Periodic Table Visualizer

Overview

The Advanced Periodic Table Visualizer is an interactive web application designed for exploring the periodic table with an intuitive and engaging user experience. Built with Streamlit, Plotly, and Pandas, it offers advanced data visualizations, statistical insights, and customizable filters for a comprehensive understanding of elemental properties and periodic trends.

Features

üîç Interactive Filters

Search elements by name, symbol, or atomic number.

Filter by group, period, metal/non-metal, and radioactivity.

Real-time updates based on applied filters.

üìä Data Visualization

Interactive Periodic Table: A structured and color-coded layout for quick identification.

Tabular View: Sortable and filterable table displaying all elements with key properties.

Graphical Analysis: Visualize trends like atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity through dynamic charts.

3D Visualization: Interactive 3D models for exploring periodic trends dynamically.

Radar Charts: Compare multiple properties across selected elements.

Element Insights: Detailed element profiles including discovery, applications, and chemical behavior.
